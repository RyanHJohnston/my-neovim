# My Neovim Configuration
Neovim is a fork of the Vim editor that utilizes plugins and allows configurations of said plugins.
Think of it as a highly-extensible VSCode that is entirely Vim and is yours. I usually build it from source for maximum speed and it is portable on any POXIS compliant operating system (it works perfectly on Windows 10). Instructions on how to set up and all of the shortcuts will be here soon.
